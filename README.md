# popular-movies-app

Project #2 of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

--> This app is expected to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing, by providing the following features :

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - plot synopsis
  - user rating
  - release date

--> In order to make the app work, you need to add your personal API Key [here](https://github.com/younes-makhtoum/popular-movies-app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/popularmovies/services/UrlBuilder.java)
--> If you don't have a personal API key yet, you can request one from your personal settings, once you have created your account on the [the moviedb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)
